<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, I'm Rashmi Mallya — a curious soul who finds joy both in crafting lines of code and in creating art with her hands. As a coding enthusiast, I love diving deep into logic and problem-solving, while my artistic heart thrives on crochet, painting, and sculpting whimsical clay models. I bring a bold and passionate energy into everything I do — always curious, fiercely creative, and not afraid to take on a challenge. Whether I’m debugging a tricky program or bringing an idea to life through art, I’m all about blending precision with imagination and turning inspiration into something real.</p>
